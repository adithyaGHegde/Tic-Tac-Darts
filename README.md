# Tic-Tac-Darts
A game that is a mixture of Tic Tac Toe and Darts. A C++ development project that uses GLUT.

Project Description:
The game is a mixture of Tic-Tac-Toe and Darts, here the goal is to get control of 3 bullseye in a row, like Tic-Tac-Toe.
However, the twist is that a player can get control of his opponent's bullseye by aiming it closer to the center.
I have implemented an Aiming mechanism using automatic locking of a target and using a power slider.
